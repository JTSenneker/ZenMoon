>>>>>>> got the grid spawn working and the targeting helper to track correctly. May need some fine tuning with the size of the collider. Still need to add different 'ground' types, but that should be easily doable

>>>>>>> added player inventory, ability to plant seeds, water tiles (currently no logic with plants), plants grow as the day changes and bloom at a set time. need to add in ability to harvest plants, resetting some and getting paid for it (when day completes). also still need to figure out why it takes 2 clicks to till ground, not just one
